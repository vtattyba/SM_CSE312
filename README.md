**Overview:**
We plan to make a social media site which allows
people to split their friends/followers into groups.
This is because there are times where you want to post
something but don't want, for example, your boss
or work friends to see. So this will allow you to put people
into groups so they can only see when you post to one of
the groups they are in. 

**Comment:** The Phase 1 code can be found in the Submit 1 Branch
